This is notably the case for lidar data, for which models can exhibit large performance discrepancies due for instance to different lidar patterns or changes in acquisition conditions. This paper addresses the corresponding Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) task for semantic segmentation. To mitigate this problem, we introduce an unsupervised auxiliary task of learning an implicit underlying surface representation simultaneously on source and target data. As both domains share the same latent representation, the model is forced to accommodate discrepancies between the two sources of data. This novel strategy differs from classical minimization of statistical divergences or lidar-specific domain adaptation techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better performance than the current state of the art, both in real-to-real and synthetic-to-real scenarios.

In the chosen hyperbolic model, such as the Poincaré ball, classification is usually conducted by leveraging a signed distance function to the hyperbolic equivalent of a plane (gyroplanes) or by measuring the alignment to a virtual fixed prototype. We propose, in a deep learning context, to leverage a different characterization of a decision boundary: Horospheres, which are level-sets of the Busemann function. They are geometrically equivalent to spheres tangent to the boundary of the hyperbolic space on a virtual point akin to a prototype. Accordingly, we define a new horospherical layer that can be adapted to any neural network backbone. In previous works, prototypes are usually uniformly distributed without using a potentially available label hierarchy for the task at hand. We also propose a hierarchically informed method for positioning these prototypes, based on the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. We find that the combination of a good initialization and optimization of the prototypes improves the baseline performance for image classification on hierarchical datasets and in two semantic segmentation tasks, conducted on image and point cloud datasets.

However, when used in a downstream setting, these models often need to be fine-tuned for a specific task after their pretraining. This fine-tuning still requires labeling information to train a classifier on top of the encoder while also updating the encoder weights. In this letter, we investigate the specific task of multimodal scene classification where a sample is composed of multiple views from multiple heterogeneous satellite sensors. We propose a method to improve the categorical cross-entropy fine-tuning process which is often used to specify the model for this downstream task. Our approach, based on the supervised contrastive (SupCon) learning, uses the label information available to train an image encoder in a contrastive manner from multiple modalities while also training the task-specific classifier online. Such a multimodal SupCon loss helps better align representations from samples coming from multiple sensors but having the same class labels, thus improving the performance of the fine-tuning process. Our experiments on two public datasets including DFC2020 and Meter-ML with Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 images show a significant gain over the baseline multimodal cross-entropy loss.","tags":[],"title":"Multimodal supervised contrastive learning in remote sensing downstream tasks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Agata Trovato","E Chassande-Mottin","M Bejger","Remi Flamary","Nicolas Courty"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"8f688b50dcbdd425f5856ca77869c006","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/trovato-2024-neural/","publishdate":"2024-09-10T23:12:57.777305Z","relpermalink":"/publication/trovato-2024-neural/","section":"publication","summary":"The search for gravitational-wave signals is limited by non-Gaussian transient noises that mimic astrophysical signals. Temporal coincidence between two or more detectors is used to mitigate contamination by these instrumental glitches. However, when a single detector is in operation, coincidence is impossible, and other strategies have to be used. We explore the possibility of using neural network classifiers and present the results obtained with three types of architectures: convolutional neural network, temporal convolutional network, and inception time. The last two architectures are specifically designed to process time-series data. The classifiers are trained on a month of data from the LIGO Livingston detector during the first observing run (O1) to identify data segments that include the signature of a binary black hole merger. Their performances are assessed and compared. We then apply trained classifiers to the remaining three months of O1 data, focusing specifically on single-detector times. The most promising candidate from our search is 2016-01-04 12:24:17 UTC. Although we are not able to constrain the significance of this event to the level conventionally followed in gravitational-wave searches, we show that the signal is compatible with the merger of two black holes with masses m1=50.7+10.4−8.9M⊙ and m2=24.4+20.2−9.3M⊙ at the luminosity distance of dL=564+812−338Mpc.

It amounts to performing domain adaptation on an unlabeled target domain without any access to source data; the available information is a model trained to achieve good performance on the source domain. A common issue with existing SFUDA approaches is that performance degrades after some training time, which is a by product of an under-constrained and ill-posed problem. We discuss two strategies to alleviate this issue. First, we propose a sensible way to regularize the learning problem. Second, we introduce a novel criterion based on agreement with a reference model. It is used (1) to stop the training when appropriate and (2) as validator to select hyperparameters without any knowledge on the target domain. Our contributions are easy to implement and readily amenable for all SFUDA methods, ensuring stable improvements over all baselines. We validate our findings on various 3D lidar settings, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Entropic affinities (EAs), which are notably used in the popular Dimensionality Reduction (DR) algorithm t-SNE, are particular instances of such graphs. To ensure robustness to heterogeneous sampling densities, EAs assign a kernel bandwidth parameter to every sample in such a way that the entropy of each row in the affinity matrix is kept constant at a specific value, whose exponential is known as perplexity. EAs are inherently asymmetric and row-wise stochastic, but they are used in DR approaches after undergoing heuristic symmetrization methods that violate both the row-wise constant entropy and stochasticity properties. In this work, we uncover a novel characterization of EA as an optimal transport problem, allowing a natural symmetrization that can be computed efficiently using dual ascent. The corresponding novel affinity matrix derives advantages from symmetric doubly stochastic normalization in terms of clustering performance, while also effectively controlling the entropy of each row thus making it particularly robust to varying noise levels. Following, we present a new DR algorithm, SNEkhorn, that leverages this new affinity matrix. We show its clear superiority to state-of-the-art approaches with several indicators on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Inter-individual variability is a major impediment when trying to draw generalizable conclusions from neuroimaging data collected on groups of subjects. Current co-registration procedures rely on limited data, and thus lead to very coarse inter-subject alignments. In this work, we present a novel method for inter-subject alignment based on Optimal Transport, denoted as Fused Unbalanced Gromov Wasserstein (FUGW). The method aligns cortical surfaces based on the similarity of their functional signatures in response to a variety of stimulation settings, while penalizing large deformations of individual topographic organization. We demonstrate that FUGW is well-suited for whole-brain landmark-free alignment. The unbalanced feature allows to deal with the fact that functional areas vary in size across subjects. Our results show that FUGW alignment significantly increases between-subject correlation of activity for independent functional data, and leads to more precise mapping at the group level.

Learning with these matrices requires using Riemanian geometry to account for their structure. In this paper, we propose a new method to deal with distributions of covariance matrices and demonstrate its computational efficiency on M/EEG multivariate time series. More specifically, we define a Sliced-Wasserstein distance between measures of symmetric positive definite matrices that comes with strong theoretical guarantees. Then, we take advantage of its properties and kernel methods to apply this distance to brain-age prediction from MEG data and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms based on Riemannian geometry. Finally, we show that it is an efficient surrogate to the Wasserstein distance in domain adaptation for Brain Computer Interface applications.

CO-optimal transport (COOT) takes this comparison further by inferring an alignment between features as well. While this approach leads to better alignments and generalizes both OT and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, we provide a theoretical result showing that it is sensitive to outliers that are omnipresent in real-world data. This prompts us to propose unbalanced COOT for which we provably show its robustness to noise in the compared datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result for OT methods in incomparable spaces. With this result in hand, we provide empirical evidence of this robustness for the challenging tasks of heterogeneous domain adaptation with and without varying proportions of classes and simultaneous alignment of samples and features across single-cell measurements.

Yet, its original formulation relies on the existence of a cost function between the samples of the two distributions, which makes it impractical for comparing data distributions supported on different topological spaces. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a novel OT problem, named COOT for CO-Optimal Transport, that aims to simultaneously optimize two transport maps between both samples and features. This is different from other approaches that either discard the individual features by focussing on pairwise distances (e.g. Gromov-Wasserstein) or need to model explicitly the relations between the features. COOT leads to interpretable correspondences between both samples and feature representations and holds metric properties. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of our framework and establish rich connections with the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. We demonstrate its versatility with two machine learning applications in heterogeneous domain adaptation and co-clustering/data summarization, where COOT leads to performance improvements over the competing state-of-the-art methods.\n","date":1604018412,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604018412,"objectID":"3e3ab3c9fbd7c9402d1985fad26b9a29","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/news/neurips2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-30T01:40:12+01:00","relpermalink":"/news/neurips2020/","section":"news","summary":"Optimal transport (OT) is a powerful geometric and probabilistic tool for finding correspondences and measuring similarity between two distributions.

However, one could argue that such a representation is hidden in the neurons and can be made explicit by teaching the model to recognize semantically interpretable attributes that are present in the scene. We call such an intermediate layer a \\emph{semantic bottleneck}. Once the attributes are learned, they can be re-combined to reach the final decision and provide both an accurate prediction and an explicit reasoning behind the CNN decision. In this paper, we look into semantic bottlenecks that capture context: we want attributes to be in groups of a few meaningful elements and participate jointly to the final decision. We use a two-layer semantic bottleneck that gathers attributes into interpretable, sparse groups, allowing them contribute differently to the final output depending on the context. We test our contextual semantic interpretable bottleneck (CSIB) on the task of landscape scenicness estimation and train the semantic interpretable bottleneck using an auxiliary database (SUN Attributes). Our model yields in predictions as accurate as a non-interpretable baseline when applied to a real-world test set of Flickr images, all while providing clear and interpretable explanations for each prediction.\n","date":1602290322,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602290322,"objectID":"36e6a8c6f77a29eb61a03870f1980315","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/news/accv2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-10T01:38:42+01:00","relpermalink":"/news/accv2020/","section":"news","summary":"One paper accepted at ACCV 2020 on Contextual Semantic Interpretability, with Diego Marcos, Ruth Fong, Sylvain Lobry, Rémi Flamary and Devis Tuia.\nPaper abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are known to learn an image representation that captures concepts relevant to the task, but do so in an implicit way that hampers model interpretability.","tags":[],"title":"One paper accepted at ACCV 2020","type":"news"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Our in-depth paper on the Fused-Gromov Wasserstein is published in a special issue of MDPI Algorithms on graphs.

End-to-end trained deep learning models use this time series data to make predictions at a large scale, for instance, to produce up-to-date crop cover maps. Most time series classification approaches focus on the accuracy of predictions. However, the earliness of the prediction is also of great importance since coming to an early decision can make a crucial difference in time-sensitive applications.\nIn this work, we present an End-to-End Learned Early Classification of Time Series (ELECTS) model that estimates a classification score and a probability of whether sufficient data has been observed to come to an early and still accurate decision. ELECTS is modular: any deep time series classification model can adopt the ELECTS conceptual idea by adding a second prediction head that outputs a probability of stopping the classification. The ELECTS loss function then optimizes the overall model on a balanced objective of earliness and accuracy. Our experiments on four crop classification datasets from Europe and Africa show that ELECTS allows reaching state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing the quantity of data massively to be downloaded, stored, and processed.","tags":[],"title":"End-to-end Learning for Early Classification of Time Series","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Titouan Vayer","Laetitia Chapel","Rémi Flamary","Romain Tavenard","Nicolas Courty"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"e1a7e69bb5d79b2c8ebbd98a5ac03e81","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/vayer-hal-02174316/","publishdate":"2024-09-10T23:12:57.671138Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vayer-hal-02174316/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance for structured objects: theoretical foundations and mathematical properties","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bharath Bhushan Damodaran","Kilian Fatras","Sylvain Lobry","Rémi Flamary","Devis Tuia","Nicolas Courty"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"512ce3b135c71a4a3aff5eaba44c26ec","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/damodaran-hal-02174313/","publishdate":"2024-09-10T23:12:57.2566Z","relpermalink":"/publication/damodaran-hal-02174313/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"Pushing the right boundaries matters!
