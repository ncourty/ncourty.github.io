The paper 'Learning with minibatch Wasserstein : asymptotic and gradient properties' from my Phd student Kilian Fatras is featured in the accepted of AISTATS 2020 (joint work with Younes Zine, Rémi Flamary and Rémi Gribonval). Kilian has written a nice [blog entry](https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-with-minibatch-wasserstein-d87dcf52efb5) on it. Be sure to check it out !
