## Biography
### Scientific interests:
  - Optimal transport, Statistical learning, kernel methods
  - Manifold and geometric approaches to machine learning
  - Applications to computer graphics, vision and remote sensing

### Code production
As a computer scientist, I definitely believe in the power of open-source and reproducibility as a basis of science. Though my current activities will not let me hand on code as much as I want to, I still enjoy coding in C++, Cuda kernels or PyTorch. Take a look at the [coding section](code/) to know more.
